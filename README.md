# Opine

A very simplistic blog system for a static website. This uses Clouldflare Workers and Cloudflare D1.

This is very early stage experiement and should not be used in a production environment.

## Configuration

Copy `wrangler-example.toml` to `wrangler.toml` and update the D1 database id and the cross origin host.
